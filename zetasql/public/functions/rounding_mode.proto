// Enum that defines the modes used for rounding values in the ROUND function
// The RoundingMode could be one of the following
// - ROUND_HALF_AWAY_FROM_ZERO: will round halfway values away from zero.
//   for example: 0.5 would round to 1, 1.5 would round to 2.
// - ROUND_HALF_EVEN: will round halfway values to the nearest even value.
//   otherwise known as bankers rounding. for example: 0.5 would round to 0,
//   1.5 would round to 2.
//
// In both rounding modes, .1 .2 .3. 4, and .6 .7 .8 and .9 behave identically
// and as expected. For example, in both rounding modes 1.1 will round down to
// 1, and 1.8 will round up to 2. Negative numbers act identical. For example,
// -1.1 will round to -1, and -1.8 will round to -2.
