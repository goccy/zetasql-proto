// query node which invoked the creation of this iterator, relative to
// the body of the stack frame's procedure. <next_row_count> stores
// the number of times NextRow() was called on the iterator.
// At deserialization, iterator is created by running the query again,
// and then calling NextRow() <next_row_count> times.
