// Proto bundles ((broken link)) may omit types that are
// referenced by other types that are included. When users do this, engines may
// include a placeholder type so that proto2 doesn't get upset. Engines could
// use the built-in proto2 placeholder feature, but it has heuristics that don't
// always work for guessing enum vs. message and exact names, and it can be
// handled better since engines have the real descriptors and can omit them.
// Engines don't need to do this for enum types, only message types, since for
// enum types engines would have to make up a fake enumeration value (since they
// must have at least one). For messages, engines can just make a message with
// no fields and this option, which engines may ignore.
